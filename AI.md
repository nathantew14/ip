Using the VSCode integrated LLM panel.

# Level-0
Used GPT-4.1 to change the ASCII art from Duke to Gertrude, but it can't seem to get the ASCII art right.Neither could Deepseek. Gave up and removed the banner. Also generated the intro in a grandmotherly tone.

# Level-1
Didn't remember how to read from the standard input, so AI helped with that, and helpfully added labelling of the messages. Auto-suggest in the CLI also helped add handling of the "bye" function without me telling it to. That's pretty impressive!

# Level-2
AI generation struggles with doing multiple things at once, so have to prompt it step-by-step.

# Level-3
AI generation automatically added error handling! Impressive.

# Level-4
Copying the entire question prompt results in an error. Had to try it haha.
AI made an extremely detailed logic flow to detect invalid combinations of /by, /start and /end flags that I would not have written by hand.
