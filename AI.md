Using the VSCode integrated Copilot panel with GPT-4.1.

# Level-0
Used GPT-4.1 to change the ASCII art from Duke to Gertrude, but it can't seem to get the ASCII art right.Neither could Deepseek. Gave up and removed the banner. Also generated the intro in a grandmotherly tone.

# Level-1
Didn't remember how to read from the standard input, so AI helped with that, and helpfully added labelling of the messages. Auto-suggest in the CLI also helped add handling of the "bye" function without me telling it to. That's pretty impressive!

# Level-2
AI generation struggles with doing multiple things at once, so have to prompt it step-by-step.

# Level-3
AI generation automatically added error handling! Impressive.

# Level-4
Copying the entire question prompt results in an error. Had to try it haha.
AI was over-eager in writing an extremely detailed logic flow to detect invalid combinations of /by, /start and /end flags, had to remove some contradicting checks.

# A-TextUiTesting
AI was unable to tell me to use chmod to allow me to run my `runtest.sh`

# Level-5
Used AI to generate the exception class and use it throughout Gertrude.

# Level-6
Hit monthly chat messages quota on the integrated VSCode Copilot :(

# A-Enums
Used Deepseek to refactor my code to use Enums in place of the command prefixes and task tags (`/by`, `/start` and `/end`), as well as to use switch-case instead. The test ensures the refactor didn't break anything.
